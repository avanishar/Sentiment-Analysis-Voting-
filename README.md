# Sentiment-Analysis-Voting-
The Sentiment-Based Voting Smart Contract is an Ethereum-based system that uses sentiment analysis to weight votes. Unlike traditional voting, it assigns voting power based on sentiment scores (1-100). Users vote for predefined candidates, with their sentiment score influencing the voteâ€™s impact.
